### Introduction

This project is the result, and continuation of a term project in INF225 (aka. The Compiler Course) at the University in Bergen. I had such a fun time doing this project during the INF225 course that I wanted to continue the project. I was lucky enough to get our instructor from INF225 to be my supervisor in INF219 (Programming Project) this semester and we agreed that continuing this project was a good idea. 

So, what is SOFA? In short, it is a scripting language for controlling the AI of three different characters in a team. And with the accompanying simulation you can put two SOFA scripts up against each other in a battle to the death, for the simulated characters atleast.

### Idea

The idea behind SOFA started with my fascination for games where you get to use programming as part of playing the game. Especially the game Game Hero, which is a first person shooter where you manipulate the world around you by shooting javascript snippets at objects ([Link](http://www.primerlabs.com)).

The original idea was somewhat more inspired by my interest in StarCraft 2 (As a spectator, not a player. I am terrible at it.). I was dreaming of a RTS (real time strategy) where you would assign scripts to your units instead of issuing commands. Imagine the mid bottom selected unit overview was a small code editor, and the command buttons were "Check Syntax", "Assign to Selected Unit(s)" etc. instead of "Attack" and "Move"? It would've been a fantastic game to play.

Now, the next step was to be realistic and consider the fact that a RTS with multiple races, buildings and units was not something I would be able to do in any realistic timeframe what so ever. So the project was scaled a bit down, and instead of being based off of an RTS I picked up some key elements from the MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) genre and gave the project a name with a funny twist, basing it sort of off the abbreviation MOBA. And then the Scripted Offline Fighting Arena, or SOFA for short, was born.
